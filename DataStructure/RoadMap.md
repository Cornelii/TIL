# RoadMap

## Why do we use Data-structure?!
* Make it use of logical structure of them,
* kind of, Basis operations => adding, removing of data
* Additional operation => Traversal. (Search all entries)
* Data-Structure: Abstract Data Type (ADT)
    1. Structure
    2. Operations (like, push, pop, sort, search)
    3. In the point of view in implementation, A thing can be done in 
    various Algorithms.

1. Linear Structures
Array, Sequene, List, Stack, Que, etc

2. Non-linear Structures?! multiple mapping?!
Tree: Binary, Binary Searching, Hip, Huffman, Try, segment, indes trees, etc.
    1. 1st-order and Linked List, etc.
    
Graph: MST, ... etc, NP class problem => Approximate approach?!, AOE, AOV, etc.
    1. Close Matrix, etc.
    2. Close List, etc.

Tree is a subset of Graph

DFS(by Stack), BFS(by Que)

pre,in,post orders


3. Algorithm design methodology
* Greedy
* Distributed Conquer? (Binary Search, quick sort, merge sort)
* Back Tracking (state-space Tree,DFS)
* Dynamic Programming (Recursive DP, repetitive DP)


*** IMportant Thing: To understand Comoplete Search
1. first understand the concepts of combinaorics?! Permutation, Combination, Subsets,etc

2. Pruning Technique is needed in search.

Problem Pool
1. Implement Command in CLI
2. Implement Big integer

(#Hash, #Tree, #Linked List)

##Pro -> Implement in short time
##Expert -> Implement the main


### Algorithm 문제만 풀 듯?!
# 정올
# 백준
# SWExpertAcademy
# C, C++, Python,Java
# Data structure- self-study is needed
