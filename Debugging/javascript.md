# Debug note in javascript

#### 1. CORS policy
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://vuefinal-firebattt.c9users.io/api/v1/memos/' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:5500' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

CORS: cross-origin resource sharing

=> ServerSide solution CORS in middleware?!
