# Mathematical thinking

## I. Visualization

* Draw out picture of your thought to expand your thinking range by new evidences, and new idea

* It helps to make you think deeper.

* **Imagination**

## II. Transition

* **3-Room method**

1. a room of dreamers
2. a room of realists
3. a room of critic (preparation for danger factors)

## III. Question

* A Good question is much better than an answer.

* Answer means end, but for question, new starts.

* educational way of jewish: hebruta

The antonyms of question is memorization.

* Sorts of tool for questions
  * No force to answer
  * express in various ways and aspects
  * opened question (Not to induce short answer yes/no)
  * Question in positive atmosphere

## IV. Proof

* Not instinctively responsive answers
* Think considering entire circumstances
* Proof is ,in short, if -> is

## V. Paradox

Even if some problems looks like paradox. (trade-offs)

Sometimes, there is a way to resolve simultaneously.

* If there is a problem which is considered impossible.
* Think again, and focus on advantages to get from it.
* And, modify it. Revise it into realistic idea.




#### Tips to solve algorithm probs


### 1. What is the wanted value in given problem?!
- **i. Continuous or Integer Value**
    - let me guess answer is known. If you can narrow range by up and down => Binary Search <span style="color:red">(Bisection-Method)</span>
    - If you can express probs as equations, and should you get gradient! => <span style="color:red">Gradient Descent (Newton Method)</span>
<br>
- **ii. Specific (usually optimul) value through some sequence of states**
    - Does Recursive Eqs exists? <span style="color:red">(Sub-Optimal) => Dynamic Programming</span>
    - You can not find Recursive Eqs => State-Search: Decide Combination / permutation, Combi / Perm with replacement. + <span style="color:red">Prunning</span>
<br>
- **iii. Sort of result after Simulations**
    -  It depends on almost purely coding ability
<br>
#### Other Tips

* **Use of Graph, Tree, Stack, Queue, Heap, Hash**
* **Time Complexity => Memory**

Learn and Use C++ for high-speed application.
