# DP (Dynamic Programming)
1. Write memoization table.
2. Remove operations that already have done.


3. Find Recursive Formula in sequence!! -> Do DP.
(Fibonacci-related.)



## I. Where is dynamic programming needed?


$$
\Omega(\H(S_{i+1}))=\Omega(\sum_k^{i}c_k\H(S_k))
\\\Omega : Optimal function
\\\H : Solution
\\ S_i : states
$$

**1. Recursive Formula~! (Suboptimal problem, Recursive Set)**
**2. Repetitive Calculations.**



#### 1. Overlapping subproblems
Recurrence relation. Repetitive use of subsolution.

#### 2. Optimal substructure
Principle of Optimality: If a solution is a optimal solution, the solution of the sub problems, which constructs the problem, are also optimal



## II. Path in Matrix Problem

## III. Put Pebble Stone in Stream Problem

## IV. Order in Matrix Multiplication Problem

## V. Longest Common Subsequence Problem
