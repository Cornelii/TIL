# Recursion

Remember the example. How many people is waiting in a line?!

In programming, recursion means a function definition that include an invocation of the function within its own body.

* This requires the function invoking itself with different arguments!

#### Fundamental aspects of recursion

1. Base case
    Without base case => infinite loop.

2. Recursive step
    a step toward base case


**Remarks**: The best way to understand recursion is with a lot of practice.

#### Stack overflow
As recursion depth goes deepder, memory cannot be taken any more. => stack overflow

Recursion has costs that iteration does not.

* Recursion is less efficient than iterative solution because of call stack.

#### Beauty of recursion is how it can reduce complex problems to elegant soltion of only a few lines of code.
