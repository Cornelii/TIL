# Greedy Algorithm
* Sort of procedures to get solution

* Choosing instant local case considered optimized
* Kind of, intuitive implementations are likely to be greedy algorithm

## Greedy Algorithm Loop
  1. At current state => add some solution to the Solution subset.
  2. Check whether it violates constraints or not. and so is executable.
  3. Check the some solution can be really solution of problem.
  4. If not go to step.1
